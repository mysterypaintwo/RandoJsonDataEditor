# RandoJsonDataVisualEditor

RandoJsonDataVisualEditor is a JSON editor designed for randomizers and other logic modifications, primarily for the Super Metroid ROM hack **X-Fusion** (Might support more in the future!?). This tool allows you to visually place and manipulate nodes on the map, making editing room connections, items, and other gameplay logic straightforward.

This project is heavily inspired by [sm-json-data](https://github.com/vg-json-data/sm-json-data).
